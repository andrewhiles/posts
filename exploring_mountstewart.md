During the Christmas break, Helen and I visited Mountstewart. Despite this beautiful place only being a ten minute drive from my house, I only discovered its wonders in October and since then I've been trying to visit it more often. We didn't have much time to walk around the grounds as it was closing early due to the holiday season timetable but we still had enough time to walk around the lake and of course, take a few photographs.
