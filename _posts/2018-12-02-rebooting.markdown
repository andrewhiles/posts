I've owned my domain, andrewhil.es, since 2013. It had always been my intention to create a website that would act as a personal journal where I could document my work, random thoughts and generally share articles on things I think others would benefit from knowing. However, shortly after I crafted my first incarnation of a holding page for andrewhil.es, things didn't progress much further.

Looking back, the last 5 years on this website haven't been much more than a basic index.html file with nothing of great interest. Thankfully, my website gets around 100 hits a month so I don't think anyone was overly disappointed when they stepped into my boring little corner of the web.

Even as I write now, I still find it difficult trying to understand why I didn't take this website project seriously. I spend a large portion of my working day tweaking things in the browser. It's a fundamental part of my occupation, to be able to craft production-ready, functional websites - but when it came to my own personal website, I just put it on a shelf and left it there.

# Finding new motivation
Back in October 2018 I FTP'd onto my web server for the first time in quite some time. I was looking for a few server configuration files when I started poking around at the content I'd created in previous years. I quickly realised I'd forgotten about my online journal for too long.

In recent months, I'd listened to various podcasts where fellow web developers mentioned the curse of seeking perfection in their work and this had really been eating at me. In my mind, maybe that's what has been holding me back from fixing this space and applying some effort to making it something worth caring for. With a shift in mindset, I'd realised that if I spent an hour here and there to try and spruce things up, eventually I'd get it to a state where it's fit enough for publishing to the world (not perfect, but a functioning work in progress). 

Fast forward to today, Saturday 8th December 2018, and I've just finished giving the website a fresh lick of paint with some basic CSS updates and it feels like the right time to deploy my changes. There's no doubt, everything is still a bit rough around the edges, but I know now that I've hit the dreaded publish button and put it on the web, that there's an element of accountability placed upon me to maintain this and turn it into something I'll (hopefully) care about for years to come.

# Moving forward
Now that I've taken the first step and published something more than just a holding page, my aim is to continue enhancing this space. I'm still using a lot of older technologies under the hood, which brings an immediate impetus to remove them and modernize where I see fit. However, for now, I want to post at least once a week. It's ambitious, but without goals, I know I'll struggle. So here we are. I hope you'll come along for the ride.
